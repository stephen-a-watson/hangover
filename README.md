The idea is to create a tool for boulderers, route setters, and other climbing enthusiasts.

A rough list of jobs in order of difficulty

+ customizable human body model
+ movement constraints of the model
+ model of max force and duration of muscles [or movement if we want to forget about individual muscles]
+ skin friction coefficients under different conditions
+ a wall with 3D holds
+ a mapping between movements and names [e.g. crimp, heel hook, etc]

+ a way for a user ask that a particular sequence of moves be simulated
+ visual recognition for indoor climbing/bouldering walls
+ AI for sequence planning
+ rating of difficulty of a problem [could depend on body shape and strength]
