The idea is to create a tool for boulderers, route setters, and other climbing enthusiasts.

Some ideas we could try modelling:

+ customizable human body
+ the movement of the human body
+ the constraints of human movement
+ each muscle (or movement type) in terms of max force and endurance
+ skin friction coefficients under different conditions
+ a wall with 3D holds

+ a way for a user ask that a particular set of moves be simulated
+ visual recognition for indoor climbing/bouldering walls
+ an AI to plan and demonstrate a route for a user
